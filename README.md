- üõ†Ô∏è Admins can review logs, manage commands, and configure behavior

## ‚ú® Features

- ‚úÖ **Discord login** via OAuth2
- üì° **RCON command interface**
- üö´ **Blacklist protection** (e.g. `/stop`, `/ban`, `/kick`)
- üßë‚Äçüíº **Admin dashboard** (by Discord ID)
- üßæ **Command logging** for transparency
- üß† **CAPTCHA** on load to stop bots
